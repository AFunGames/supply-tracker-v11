# food-and-water-tracker
 A Foundry VTT module that makes it easier to track food and water.

## How to install
You can install Food and Water Tracker by pasting the following manifest link into Foundry's package browser: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stendarpaval/food-and-water-tracker/main/module.json`.

## How to use
After installing this module, you need to go to an actor's <strong>Special Traits</strong> menu. This menu is found on the Attributes tab of actor sheets. Inside the "Special Traits" menu, scroll down to find the "Food and Water" section added by this module. Check the "Track Food and Water" checkbox to start tracking food and water for that actor. The other options here allow you to manually configure relevant tracking variables.

Whenever characters that have food and water tracking enabled take a short or long rest (configurable in Food and Water Tracker's module settings), they will be presented with the following screen:

The DC of the Constitution saving throw is configurable in the module's settings, where you will also find a toggle for hot weather. As the text in the screenshot above says, this module will increase a character's exhaustion level when appropriate based on the Food and Water rules found in the SRD version 5.1, page 86 and 87.

## New

As of v1.2.0 there are options for showing custom food and water rules, as well as to make use of a list of food items on the actor in question. See the example screenshots below.

(Apparently, waterskins are considered food in dnd5e. Interesting. Lots of fiber, I'm sure.)
